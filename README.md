Description

React is a library with so much power, but so few strong opinions. So building something significant requires a large number of decisions and work to build the foundation. In Building Applications with React and Redux in ES6, you will learn how to use Redux, React Router, and ES6 to build powerful and fast React applications from the ground up, as well as use Webpack, Babel, ESLint, npm scripts, Mocha, Enzyme. Finally, you will create a rapid feedback development environment that runs linting and tests, transpiles ES6 to ES5, starts up Express as a webserver, opens the application, and hot reloads changes every time you hit save and deploys with a single command. When you're finished with this course, you will have a foundational knowledge of React and Redux in ES6 that will help you as you move forward building robust, scalable React applications using a custom, rapid feedback development environment.

commands:

 - npm install
 - npm start -s (main command)
 - npm run test
 - npm run lint
